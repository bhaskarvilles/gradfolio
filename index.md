[Bhaskar](https:bhaskarvilles.dev){:target="_blank"} is a developer and hacker from India. I am very passionate, freaky about technology and computers. I was basically building the normal Linux, Windows and Mac machines and use them as full as their potential on top of their technological limitations. Then came to realized that Blockchain technology and Newer protocols will change the way we use computers in future, then i had learned about blockchain technology and smart contracts and now developing something new and cool. I am a technology activist and also hack computers for living (only ethically).

As i learned lots of newer technologies i was now working for the lot of open-source projects like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io),[Fleek](https://fleek.co),[libp2p](https://libp2p.io),[Multiformats](https://multiformats.io),[DNSLink](https://dnslink.dev),[Internet Computer](https://dfnity.org),[My TIKI](https://mytiki.com),[NSA's Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.com), [Pinata Cloud](https://pinata.cloud) Some other projects related to [Hyperledger Foundation](https://hyperledger.org), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io). All are open-source and my current projects 

I also develop private blockchains, write smart contracts using Solidity and Truffle. I design Web 3 static websites as of now. you can contact me and get yours by hiring me.
